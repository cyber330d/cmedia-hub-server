HTTP	gRPC	Description
200	OK	No error.
400	INVALID_ARGUMENT	Client specified an invalid argument. Check error message and error details for more information.
400	FAILED_PRECONDITION	Request can not be executed in the current system state, such as deleting a non-empty directory.
400	OUT_OF_RANGE	Client specified an invalid range.
401	UNAUTHENTICATED	Request not authenticated due to missing, invalid, or expired OAuth token.
403	PERMISSION_DENIED	Client does not have sufficient permission. This can happen because the OAuth token does not have the right scopes, the client doesn't have permission, or the API has not been enabled.
404	NOT_FOUND	A specified resource is not found.
409	ABORTED	Concurrency conflict, such as read-modify-write conflict.
409	ALREADY_EXISTS	The resource that a client tried to create already exists.
429	RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED	Either out of resource quota or reaching rate limiting. The client should look for google.rpc.QuotaFailure error detail for more information.
499	CANCELLED	Request cancelled by the client.
500	DATA_LOSS	Unrecoverable data loss or data corruption. The client should report the error to the user.
500	UNKNOWN	Unknown server error. Typically a server bug.
500	INTERNAL	Internal server error. Typically a server bug.
501	NOT_IMPLEMENTED	API method not implemented by the server.
502	N/A	Network error occurred before reaching the server. Typically a network outage or misconfiguration.
503	UNAVAILABLE	Service unavailable. Typically the server is down.
504	DEADLINE_EXCEEDED	Request deadline exceeded. This will happen only if the caller sets a deadline that is shorter than the method's default deadline (i.e. requested deadline is not enough for the server to process the request) and the request did not finish within the deadline.
Warning: Google APIs may concurrently check multiple preconditions for an API request. Returning one error code does not imply other preconditions are satisfied. Application code must not depend on the ordering of precondition checks.
