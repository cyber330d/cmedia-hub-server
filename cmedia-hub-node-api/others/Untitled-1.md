8. Media Upload and Processing
8.1 Media Upload Workflow
Uploading Media
When a user uploads media content to MediaHub, the following workflow is followed:

User Upload: The user selects the media file to upload through the web interface.

Validation: The system performs initial validation, checking file format, size, and other constraints. Invalid files are rejected with appropriate error messages.

Storage Allocation: If the media file passes validation, the system allocates storage space in the distributed file storage system. Metadata about the uploaded media, including the user's account information and file details, is recorded in the metadata database.

Notification: The user receives a confirmation notification that the upload was successful and that the media content is available for further management.

8.2 Media Processing Workflow
On-the-Fly Transcoding
To ensure compatibility and efficient streaming, MediaHub employs on-the-fly transcoding for uploaded media. The processing workflow is as follows:

User Request: When a user requests to stream or view media content, the system checks the user's device and network conditions.

Transcoding Profile Selection: Based on the user's device and network conditions, the system selects an appropriate transcoding profile. Profiles are defined for various bitrates and resolutions.

Transcoding: If necessary, the system transcodes the media file on-the-fly to match the selected profile. This ensures compatibility and optimal quality for the user's device and network.

Streaming: The transcoded media is then streamed to the user's device in real-time, ensuring a seamless viewing experience.
